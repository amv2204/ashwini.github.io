## Survival Analysis Example:

**Dataset of Interest:** This data is a subset of data from a cohort study on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The study includes medical, epidemiologic, and behavioral information from individuals who are HIV positive. Below is the data dictionary:

<center>
<img src="images/codebook.jpg" style="width:80%">
</center>

**Research question: We will examine if having a diagnosis of hepatitis C is associated with a shorter median survival time compared to not having hepatitis C.**

### Code:

**Creating a libname to refer to shared folder:**

libname Epi3 "/home/u60713693/my_shared_file_links/u2704008";

**Copy and explore the data:**

data hivhepc;   
set Epi3.hivhepc;   
run;

proc contents data= hivhepc;    
run;

**Calculate person-time for each individual:**

data hivhepc2;    
set hivhepc;    
if death=1 then days=death_date-cohort_date;    
else if death=0 then days=last_alive_date-cohort_date;    
pyears=days/365.25;  *gives time-to-event in years;   
run;

### General survival curve:

proc lifetest data= hivhepc2 method=km plots=(s) graphics;    
time pyears*death(0);   
run;

The full results of the proc lifetest can be seen [here](survival.html).

Below is the survival curve:

<center>
<img src="images/general_survival.jpg" style="width:95%">
</center>

The median survival time is 12.08 years, which is interpreted as: We expect 50% of people to survive beyond 12.08 years.

Another interpretation example: Using the table and the 'pyears' value closest to 5 (which is 4.9993), the 5-year survival probability is 0.8470, which means that probability of surviving beyond 5 years from the time of HIV diagnosis is 0.8470.

### Survival curve by Hep. C diagnosis:

proc lifetest data= hivhepc2 method=km plots=(s)graphics;   
time pyears*death(0);   
strata HepC;    
run;

The full results of the proc lifetest can be seen [here](hepc.html).

Below is the survival curve:

<center>
<img src="images/hepc.jpg" style="width:80%">
</center>

The median survival proportion for those with a Hep. C diagnosis is 11.33 years and for those without a Hep. C diagnosis is 14.33 years. This means that individuals who are HIV+ survive longer if they don't have a Hep. C diagnosis.

### Significance of survival curves:

The log-rank test has a null hypothesis that the two survival curves are homogeneous (not different from one another). Given the p-value of the statistic (p=0.0307), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the survival curves ARE NOT HOMOGENOUS and are STATISTICALLY significantly different.

### Univariable Cox Regression:

**We will run a Cox regression model to investigate the association between survival and having a Hepatitis C diagnosis among HIV+ males.**

proc phreg data=lab7;   
model pyears*death(0)= hepc / ties=efron rl;    
run;

The full results of the regression can be seen [here](univariable.html).

**The hazard ratio is 1.385 with a 95% CI (1.029, 1.863).**

**The interpretation is: Among HIV+ males, those with Hep. C have a 38.5% higher hazard of death compared to those without Hep. C. We are 95% confident the true hazard is between 2.9% and 86.3%.**

### Assessing the Proportional Hazard Assumption:

**The assumption: At any point in time, the ratio of the hazards for any two individuals or groups is constant.**

There are 3 ways to check the assumption:

**1. Graph the curves and visually inspect to see if the curves are proportional**    
**2. Model an interaction term between the log of time and the covariate**    
**3. Use cumulative sums of martingale-based residuals** 

#### Method 1:

proc phreg data=lab7;   
model pyears*death(0) = IVdruguse/ties =efron;    
strata IVdruguse;   
baseline out=c loglogs=lls survival=s;    
run;    

proc gplot data=c ;   
plot lls*pyears  =IVdruguse;    
symbol1 interpol=join color=magenta line=1;   
symbol2 interpol=join color=navy line=1;    
title 'Proportional Hazards Assumption for Variable IVdruguse';   
run;    
quit;   

<center>
<img src="images/graph_haz.jpg" style="width:80%">
</center>

Visually, the lines do not seem to be proportional; at some points they are close and at others, they diverge.

#### Method 2:

data survival;    
set lab7;   
LNpy=log(pyears);   
run;    

proc phreg data=survival;   
model pyears*death(0) = IVdruguse LNpy*IVdruguse/ties=efron;    
run;    

<center>
<img src="images/meth2.jpg" style="width:80%">
</center>

The interaction term has a p-value <.0001 which is less than 0.05, thus significant. This means that the hazard function changes over time and that the assumption is violated.

#### Method 3:

proc phreg data=lab7;   
model pyears*death(0) = IVdruguse/ties =efron;    
assess ph / resample seed=40262001;   
run;    

<center>
<img src="images/assess.jpg" style="width:80%">
</center>

The observed path has deviated appreciably from the cloud of paths generated via simulations that followed the proportional hazard assumption. In addition, the p-value for the test of proportional hazards was 0.0180 which is less than 0.05. We can conclude again that the assumption is not met.

#### Solutions to the violation of the assumption:

1. Stratify by the levels of the variable for which the assumption fails
2. Stratify by time (fit separate Cox models to different time intervals)
3. Extensions of Cox models to allow for covariates that vary with time
