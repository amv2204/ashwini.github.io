# About me


I am currently a second year Master's in Public Health candidate in the Epidemiology department at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. I am also completing a certificate in Infectious Disease Epidemiology. I will be graduating in May 2023 and am looking for full time opportunities!

I am the oldest of 3 and grew up in Edison, New Jersey. I went to Rutgers University - New Brunswick for my undergrad and completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health with a minor in Biological Sciences and a certificate in Health Disparities. 

My favorite activities are to try cooking new recipes and touring NYC restaurants and activities. One of my life goals is to travel to one new country every year and explore!
